The DiscussionTopic plugin increase user engagement and enhance self-help by adding sharing a topic across multiple discussions.  The plugin adds a Topic field to the discussion table and operates in several modes:
1. Manual - authorized users can manually add a topic to a discussion
2. Automatic deterministic - by picking double quoted phrases from the discussion title or through "Priority phrases" defined by the administrator.
3. Heuristic analysis - through an approximation of linguistic analysis (English only) picking key terms as the topic.

The most effective result is through the plugin side panel which shows the titles of other discussions sharing the same topic.  Clicking on any one of the titles brings the appropriate discussion with the same side-panel, in effect allowing users to review related discussions.

I ran a test on the Vanilla forum (using the forum feed) and after simple tuning of the plugin through the configuration screen I was able to see positive results.  Your results may vary.
