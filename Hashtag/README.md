​The Hashtag plugin automatically adds tags from hashtags embedded in the discussion title and optionally from the discussion and comment contents.

Optionally, the plugin can set embedded hashtags as links to all tags of the same value.

This plugin requires the official Tagging plugin.

User permissions in Roles and Permissions must be set to activate the plugin functionality.

The Administrator can modify some of the plugin functionality through the plugin dashboard.​
